/**
 * RECURSION
 * A function that calls itself is called recursive.

A recursive function calls itself to reduce a larger problem into a smaller one, until it can be solved.

A recursive function must have two properties:

A simple base case (or cases) - which is a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
A set of rules that reduce all other cases towards the base case
Recursion is not yet in our coding tool kit. Solving things recursively takes practice and may feel quite odd at first.
